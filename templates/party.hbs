{{!--
  Party HUD Template

  This template shows the smaller display for each character in your party.
  It loops through a list of characters (each stored in "c") and for each one, it displays:
    - A small picture (avatar)
    - Basic character info like their name and class
    - Their current health in a simple health bar

  This template is used to quickly see information about all party members on the screen.
