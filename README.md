# foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e

This module enhances the D&D 5e system in FoundryVTT with a custom UI, originally created by erizocosmico and later modified by [your_username] with AI assistance.

## Fancy UI 5e

### Install
- **Manifest URL**: 'https://github.com/dungeonblaster/fancyui2/releases/download/v1.0.0/module.json'
- **Compatibility**: Explicitly designed for FoundryVTT v13 and dnd5e system version 4.3.4.

### Features
- **Character Panel**: Players can manage their character without opening the sheet, including:
  - Managing hit points directly from the HUD.
  - Rolling ability, save, and skill checks.
  - **Actions Tab**: Now displays favorited items (spells, consumables, weapons, feats).
- **Party HUD**: Toggleable via settings, allowing players and GMs to view and manage party hit points, with an option to disable for a cleaner screen.
- **UI Updates**: Removed the intrusive theme for a simpler look, keeping the focus on gameplay.

### Update Notes
This fork was entirely updated using AI assistance (Grok and o3-mini-high) due to my limited coding expertise. As a result, I might not be able to easily maintain or update this module further—sorry about that! Key changes include:
- **Removed Intrusive Theme**: Got rid of the heavy styling to make it less in-your-face.
- **Toggleable Party HUD**: Added a setting to turn the party HUD on or off, giving you control over screen space.
- **Actions Tab for Favorites**: Shifted the Actions section to focus on favorited items, with hover tooltips for quick info, built explicitly for v13 and dnd5e 4.3.4.
- **Targeted Compatibility**: This version is tailored for FoundryVTT v13 and dnd5e 4.3.4, ensuring no deprecated methods are used.

### Original Credits
All credit for the foundational module goes to **erizocosmico**, who created this awesome UI. I’ve just tinkered with it using AI to suit my needs. Check out the original work at [https://github.com/erizocosmico/foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e](https://github.com/erizocosmico/foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e).
