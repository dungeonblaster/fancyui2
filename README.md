# foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e

This module enhances the D&D 5e system in FoundryVTT with a custom UI, originally created by erizocosmico and later modified by [your_username] with AI assistance.

## Fancy UI 5e

**Original Background**: Image by Thomas Bourdon for *Exploring Eberron* by Keith Baker.

### Install
- **Manifest URL**: [Insert your updated manifest URL here once you’ve pushed changes, e.g., `https://github.com/your_username/foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e/releases/download/v1.6.0/module.json`]
- **Compatibility**: Explicitly designed for FoundryVTT v13 and dnd5e system version 4.3.4.

### Features
- **Character Panel**: Players can manage their character without opening the sheet, including:
  - Managing hit points directly from the HUD.
  - Rolling ability, save, and skill checks.
  - **Actions Tab**: Now displays favorited items (spells, consumables, weapons, feats) with hover tooltips showing name, type, and description, mimicking Foundry’s native style.
- **Party HUD**: Toggleable via settings, allowing players and GMs to view and manage party hit points, with an option to disable for a cleaner screen.
- **UI Updates**: Removed the intrusive theme for a simpler look, keeping the focus on gameplay.

### Update Notes
This fork was entirely updated using AI assistance (Grok by xAI) due to my limited coding expertise. As a result, I might not be able to easily maintain or update this module further—sorry about that! Key changes include:
- **Removed Intrusive Theme**: Got rid of the heavy styling to make it less in-your-face.
- **Toggleable Party HUD**: Added a setting to turn the party HUD on or off, giving you control over screen space.
- **Actions Tab for Favorites**: Shifted the Actions section to focus on favorited items, with hover tooltips for quick info, built explicitly for v13 and dnd5e 4.3.4.
- **Targeted Compatibility**: This version is tailored for FoundryVTT v13 and dnd5e 4.3.4, ensuring no deprecated methods are used.

### Original Credits
All credit for the foundational module goes to **erizocosmico**, who created this awesome UI. I’ve just tinkered with it using AI to suit my needs. Check out the original work at [https://github.com/erizocosmico/foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e](https://github.com/erizocosmico/foundryvtt-fancy-ui-5e).

### Original Features by erizocosmico
- Character panel for managing characters without the sheet.
- Hit point management.
- Rolling actions (weapons, spells, etc.), abilities, saves, and skills.
- Party panel for viewing and managing party hit points.
- Nicer sidebar and chat UI, hidden navigation, hotbar, and player list (except for GM), minimized controls unless hovered, and hidden Foundry logo.

This module reflects how I wanted my setup to work, but feel free to fork and tweak it further—it’s all open-source love! Thanks to erizocosmico for the base, and to AI for helping me stumble through the updates.
