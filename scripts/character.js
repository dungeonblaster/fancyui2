/**
 * Gets the character (actor) that is currently controlled.

 * the actor (character) that token represents.
 *
 * If no token is selected, it tries to use the character assigned to your user.
 *
 * @returns {Actor5e|undefined} The actor (character) that is currently controlled, or undefined if none.

 * @example
 * // If you have a token selected, getCharacter() returns that actor.
 * const actor = getCharacter();
 * console.log(actor.name); // Might print "Barbarian"
